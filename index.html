<h2>Low level optimisation services</h2>

<p>
We are a few engineers passionate about low level software, optimisation, and
assembly, with a strong experience at companies like Apple and ARM.
</p>
<p>
We can implement algorithms on request, or profile your application to identify
bottlenecks and suggest optimisations to implement using efficient low level
code, assembly, and SIMD.
</p>
<p>
ARM assembly (v7, v8 32 and 64 bits, NEON) is surely our strongest skill, but
our expertise also covers Intel (x86, x86_64, SSE and other SIMD extensions)
or MIPS, and we can certainly transition to other architectures.
