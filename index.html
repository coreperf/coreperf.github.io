<h2>Low level optimisation services</h2>

<p>
We are a few engineers passionate about low level software, optimisation, and
assembly.
</p>
<p>
We can implement software or algorithms on request, or profile your application
to identify bottlenecks and suggest optimisations to implement using efficient
low level code, assembly, and SIMD.
We are used to work with ARM assembly (v7, v8 32 and 64 bits, NEON), but also
Intel or MIPS, and we can certainly transition to other architectures.
</p>
<p>
A few of our projects will be published <a href="/projects/">here</a>, so you can
have a look and
<a href="mailto:alexandre@coreperf.com" >contact us</a> to discuss how we could
help you.
